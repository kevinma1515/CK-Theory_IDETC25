Material testing ensures durability and eco-friendliness, while design testing guarantees visibility and ease of use, even with gloves. Interdisciplinary research with biomechanics, materials science, and data privacy experts addresses technical challenges. Transitioning from concept to knowledge involves pilot studies to measure biometric feedback effectiveness, comprehensive documentation of findings, and iterative refinements based on user and environmental feedback, ultimately transforming the ABNH into a validated innovation within the Knowledge Space.]\n",
