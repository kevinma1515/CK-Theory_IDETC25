,Title,Description
0,Secure Grip,"The nail holder must firmly secure nails of various sizes and lengths, preventing slipping or shifting during hammering."
1,Durability,The nail holder should be robust enough to withstand repeated hammer impacts without deforming or breaking.
2,Safety,The nail holder must protect the user's fingers and hands from accidental hammer strikes and potential injuries.
3,Ease of Use,"The nail holder should allow quick and effortless insertion and removal of nails, even when the user is wearing gloves."
4,Compatibility,The nail holder must accommodate a wide range of nail sizes and types commonly used in carpentry and construction tasks.
5,Visibility,"The nail holder should provide clear visibility of the nail head and the target area, enabling precise and accurate hammering."
6,Ergonomic Design,"The nail holder must be ergonomically designed for comfortable handling, reducing hand fatigue during extended use."
7,Material Quality,"The nail holder should be made from durable, corrosion-resistant materials suitable for both indoor and outdoor applications."
8,Compact and Lightweight,"The nail holder must be compact, lightweight, and portable, allowing for easy storage and convenient carrying in tool belts or toolboxes."

10,Sharp Edges,The nail holder should not have sharp edges or corners that could injure the user or damage surfaces.
11,Slippery Surface,The nail holder should not have a slippery or smooth surface that reduces grip and control during use.
12,Fragile Components,The nail holder should not contain fragile or easily breakable components that fail under normal hammering conditions.
13,Excessive Weight,"The nail holder should not be excessively heavy, as this would cause user fatigue and reduce maneuverability."
14,Complicated Mechanisms,The nail holder should not have overly complicated or intricate mechanisms that make it difficult to use or maintain.
15,Limited Nail Compatibility,"The nail holder should not be restricted to only one specific nail size or type, limiting its versatility and usefulness."
16,Poor Visibility,"The nail holder should not obstruct the user's view of the nail head or target area, as this would reduce accuracy and precision."
17,Corrosion-Prone Materials,"The nail holder should not be made from materials prone to rust or corrosion, which would shorten its lifespan and reliability."
18,Loose or Unstable Parts,"The nail holder should not have loose or unstable parts that could detach or shift during hammering, posing safety hazards."
19,High Cost Without Added Value,"The nail holder should not be overly expensive without providing additional functionality, durability, or quality benefits to justify the higher price."
20,[Validated Feasibility of Magnetic Suspension Nail Holder: Conditional Innovation Dependent on Non-Ferromagnetic Compatibility and Cost-Benefit Justification],"[The Magnetic Suspension Nail Holder concept has been systematically evaluated using C-K Theory principles, demonstrating strong alignment with existing knowledge criteria such as secure grip, durability, safety, ease of use, visibility, ergonomic design, material quality, compactness, and lightweight construction. The innovative use of magnetic suspension technology effectively addresses user safety by eliminating direct finger contact with nails, significantly enhancing precision, ergonomics, and visibility during hammering tasks. However, two critical knowledge gaps have been identified: (1) limited compatibility with non-ferromagnetic nails, requiring additional design solutions or complementary gripping mechanisms; and (2) potential higher manufacturing costs associated with advanced magnetic components, necessitating a thorough cost-benefit analysis to justify market viability. Consequently, the concept is deemed feasible and innovative, provided these conditional aspects—compatibility with diverse nail materials and cost-effectiveness—are strategically addressed through further development and validation.]"
21,"[Validated Strategic Expansion of Knowledge Space: Hybrid Gripping Solutions, Economic Feasibility Thresholds, Cost-Optimized Magnetic Materials, and User Acceptance Criteria for Universal and Cost-Effective Nail Holder Innovation]","[Title: Hybrid Gripping Solutions for Universal Nail Compatibility  
Description: A purely magnetic suspension mechanism inherently limits compatibility to ferromagnetic nails. Validated knowledge confirms the necessity of integrating complementary non-magnetic gripping mechanisms—such as adjustable spring-loaded jaws, friction-enhanced grips, or mechanical locking systems—to ensure universal compatibility with both ferromagnetic and non-ferromagnetic nails, significantly enhancing practical usability and market value.

Title: Economic Feasibility Threshold for Magnetic Suspension Integration  
Description: Advanced magnetic suspension technology involves higher manufacturing complexity and costs. Validated knowledge establishes the necessity of defining clear economic feasibility thresholds through comprehensive cost-benefit assessments. These assessments must quantify value delivered, including reduced user injuries, improved productivity and precision, decreased material wastage, and enhanced ergonomics, clarifying conditions under which magnetic suspension technology is commercially justified.

Title: Complementary Material Options for Cost Optimization of Magnetic Components  
Description: High-grade magnetic materials, such as neodymium alloys, significantly increase manufacturing costs. Validated knowledge indicates the strategic importance of exploring alternative lower-cost magnetic or magnetically-assisted materials, including ceramic magnets, composite magnet structures, or hybrid magnetic assemblies. Confirming alternative materials that meet minimum performance and durability requirements will substantially improve cost-effectiveness.

Title: User Acceptance Validation for Novel Nail Holder Solutions  
Description: Adoption of innovative nail holder solutions, such as magnetic suspension or hybrid gripping systems, depends critically on validated user acceptance criteria. Knowledge validation requires explicit user acceptance testing, evaluating perceived ease of use, ergonomics, workflow integration, portability, reliability, and trustworthiness. Confirming positive user acceptance through structured trials is essential for successful market introduction.]"
